                 AMOS Professional Misc Extension
                 --------------------------------

This extension should originally be shareware, but now AMOS won't be
updated and it's a bit old too. So this extension is now Public Domain
and includes source code (written in DevPac assembler). You may expand
this extension or copy some routines to the code of your extension, but
please, enter my name in the manual, such like: "Greetings to Frank Otto"
or "some routines from Misc Extension by Frank Otto". Thanks!

Maybe you already noticed that this extension is very buggy. Some commands
force AMOS to crash. Maybe I'll create a new version, but why don't you?
Just debug this extension and send it to Aminet. Do what you want with it,
it's Public Domain!

OK, to install it to AMOS Pro, just copy the "AMOSPro_Misc.Lib" to your
APSystem folder, load the Interpreter config and enter at number 23
"AMOSPro_Misc.Lib". Reboot AMOS Pro and...ready...!

Now the new commands:

Dled On                       Turns on drive led, don't ask me, where
                              this is for, but maybe when the drive led
                              doesn't stop reading, use the next command.

Dled Off                      Turns off drive led.

Display Off                   Turns display off. What you do, opening
                              screens etc., you don't see anything.

Display On                    Turns on display.

Multi Off                     Turns off Multitasking and increases about
                              10 % speed.

Multi On                      Turns Multitasking on. --WARNING-- you have to
                              turn it on again before you go back to the
                              editor or AMOS will crash.

Mouse Off                     Hides mouse and sprite 0. Better than "hide"
                              because the mouse is hidden forever, even in
                              the editor. 
                            -->Suggestion: If you want to expand this 
                              extension, why not make a "Mouse On" command?

Reset                         Resets your Amiga as if you press Ctrl+A+A and
                              destroys all (?) viruses.

Clear Ram                     Cleans up Memory by deleting all not-used
                              fonts, libs, etc.

Disk Wait                     Waits until you insert a new disk.

Firewait                      Waits until pressing fire button. Nothing else
                              than "While Fire(1)=0 : Wend" but more effective,
                              cause it's in assembler. A great command for
                              a pause function in a game.
                           -->Suggestion: You can make more wait-commands that
                              wait for left-mouse, right-,...

Pal On                        Forces AMOS to display everything in PAL
                              This command is not ready yet, it's very
                              buggy and forces AMOS to crash, so be careful!
                           -->Suggestion: debug this command and add "Pal Off"
                              command that switches to Ntsc.
