Bank format not understood (37)

The extension couldn't understand the format of a data bank.  Either
the bank is not of the appropriate type (for example, Bank To Igadget
requires a bank previously created with Igadget To Bank), or the
bank was created with a newer version of the extension which used a
different bank format.


Bank not defined (36)

You tried to access a bank that did not exist (for example, trying to
retrieve gadget definitions from a bank with Bank To Igadget).


Inconsistent data (38)

Usually indicates that a memory bank (e.g. for Bank To Igadget) has
become corrupted.  Re-create the bank; if this does not solve the
problem, then there may be a bug in the Intuition Extension itself.
Send me the program which causes the error so I can fix it.
