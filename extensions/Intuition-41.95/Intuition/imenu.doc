IMENU$
------

Imenu$(menu [,item [,sub]])=s$
s$=Imenu$(menu [,item [,sub]])

Defines a menu, item, or subitem.  Menu is the menu number; it can
range from 1 to 31.  Item, the item number, can be 1-63, and sub, the
subitem number, can be 1-31.

A menu is a set of options that the user can select to control the
actions of a program.  A menu can contain zero or more items -
although a menu with zero items is not very useful! - which are drawn
underneath the menu when it is selected; that is, when the user
presses the right mouse button and moves the pointer over the menu
name.  Each of those items can have zero or more subitems.  If a menu
item has subitems, then when the user places the pointer over the menu
item, the list of subitems appears to the right of the menu item.

By checking which menu item the user has selected (see the @{"=Ichoice " link C_Ichoice}
function), you can act appropriately; for example, when the user
chooses the "Quit" function, your program would close down and exit.

The first form of Imenu$ creates or removes a menu, item, or subitem,
depending on how many of menu, item, and sub you pass to Imenu$.  When
a menu is initially created, it contains no items; a newly-created
item contains no subitems.  The menu's or item's string is set to s$.
If s$ is empty, the appropriate menu/item (along with all subitems) is
deleted.

The second form of Imenu$ returns the current string for the given
menu/item.  If it does not exist, an empty string is returned.

In either case, an out-of-range value will cause an Illegal Function
Call error; a value of 0 is equivalent to omitting the parameter.  If
any parameter is included (and non-zero), all the parameters before it
must also be included and non-zero.  So calling Imenu$(1,0,2) will
result in an error.

In order for the user to be able to use the menus you have created,
you will need to use the @{" Imenu On " link C_ImenuOnOff} instruction.  Once menus are
activated, you cannot make any changes without first deactivating them
(with @{" Imenu Off " link C_ImenuOnOff}).
