Well, first if you plan on making _any_ money at all, if you're going to 
disable screen closing, you should really get rid of the instructions to 
find the screen base.  This works quite well:

Amos To Back
IWindow Open Wb 1,20,20,400,100,"Watch me disappear!"
B=Iwindow Base
Wait 100
_CLOSED=Intcall(-72)
Wait 20
Amos To Front

Do I get a registered version for that? ;-)

Also, is there any chance of incorporating the Intuition Wait() commands, 
instead of having to check the menus, all the gadgets etc in the main 
loop?  Something like this:

EVENT = IWait Event (WINDOWNUMBER)

Even would equal something like:

1 - menu selected
2 - gadget clicked
3 - Window flags changed (moved etc)

etc

then you could use:

_DATA = IEvent Data

which would be the gadget number that was clicked, the window that was 
changed, the menu number that was selected, etc.

This would be a lot neater and use less CPU time.

Other than that, this is a great extension and something I really plan on 
using to write my next (first :) ) "Major" program - a BBS.  I especially 
like the way you can past icons onto Intuition screens, and copy between 
AMOS and Intuition screens.  This easy way of assing graphics could 
really liven up some programs :)

Anyway, keep it up, it's looking good.  I'll do some examples for you :)
