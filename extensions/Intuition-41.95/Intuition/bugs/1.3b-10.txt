OK, got the library installed last night and then tried to run my program....

set Igadget Hslider and Vslider crash the machine with guru message

#80000004

when Igadget On is called.

Itrap won't stop this guru...so I have to reload every time....

Please let me know what you think the problem may be....I'm using the AMOS 2
files that you sent me, so there shouldn't be a problem....although my copy of
AMOS 2 get spurious bytes of data in the menu texts and stuff...which might of
(errm might have I mean (bad english)) a problem with initial UU Transfer....
everything else works fine though...Compiler etc etc

While i think about it is there any chance of writing an AMOS Procedure that
will stop GURUS from being fatal...ie make them recoverable or is that not
possible...it's a nightmare having to boot up (off floppy) each time.

As far as I could work out from the brief tests I did, it was only these 2 sliders that crashed trhe machine....toggle and hit were ok, I didn't try string
gadget...

Thanks
JOE
