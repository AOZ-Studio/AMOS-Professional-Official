Hi Andy

I am sending you this privately cos I don't want to show myself up :-)

Right the Intuition Ext. Does it draw buttons on the screen as you would
expect it to?

When I use Igadget it defines (and reacts) to the zone where the button
should be but there is no visible button, surely we don't have to write in
our own button drawing routines do we? I did this and it slows things down
quite horribly. I am sure it's summit stupid I am doing, so can you put 
me straight please?


I was attempting to write an easy to use Archiver/de-archiver called Exarc.
By the way the text gadget and sliders work fine.
I am using an A1200 4meg Amos Pro V2.

'requester title  
Irequest Def Title "ExArc Request"

Iwindow_open Wb 0,0,0,640,200,"ExArc V1.0"

Itext 24,18,"Extract"
Itext 24,38,"Archive"

Reserve Igadget 2
Set Igadget Hit 1,24,10,64,12
Set Igadget Hit 2,24,30,64,12

Igadget On 
Amos To Back 

'main loop 

Do 
Multi Wait 
   EVENT=Iwait Event

A=Igadget Read(1)
  If A=True
  _EXTRACT
End If 

A=Igadget Read(1)
  If A=True
  _ARCHIVE
End If 

If EVENT=Ievent Close
   Exit 
   End If 
Loop 

Itrap On 
Iscreen Close 0
Itrap Off 
Iwindow Close Wb 0
Amos To Front 
Edit 


Procedure _EXTRACT
Iwrite "extract ok"
End Proc

Procedure _ARCHIVE
Iwrite "archive ok"
End Proc



I haven't put the extension in the F1 cat yet as I would like to see how
this problem turns out. Our Amos customers would have my balls if you have
to write your own buttons (I am sure you don't but this needs to be sorted)
