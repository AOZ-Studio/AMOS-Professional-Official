Thanks for the quick response!

 I edited the Amiga Guide  Instruction file into a command reference guide
with Page Stream 2.22 and it prints out to a 72 page 5 1/2" by 8" booklet
(including index). If you have Page Stream and would like I can send you a
copy of the file. It came out to about 121K . Of course it is for 1.3 and
will need to be edited for the new stuff.

I installed the new AP library and tried my test program and got the same
Address Error 80000003. Here is my test program you can clip it and use the
merge asc function. I don't know if I am making all the calls I need to be
in definning the gadgets. It has also been a few month since I worked with
this.

If you prefer I can uue the program.
Since I only have an Opal vision card and no one supports it for mosaic. I
use Netscape on my 486 bridge card to surf the net. I used UUDOALL under
Windozzz to convert the file you sent. What is the UUE incoders we use on
the Amiga? I prefer to work on the Amiga but it was cheaper to get Netscape
