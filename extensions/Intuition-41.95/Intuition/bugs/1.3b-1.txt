    Hello Andy ! First bug report ! (fast, heh ?)

    Well, I tested the beta version of your extension, and I even didn't
manage to run Intuiviewer !!

    When I run it, the window appears normaly. Then I select the LOAD option :
the file requester appears and I choose an HAM6 640x512 pixels picture.

    I wait, but nothing happens. Then I switch back to AMOS, and I see that
an "OUT OF MEMORY" error occured on the IREQUEST FILE$("Select an IFF ILBM
picture") command.


    Hum, well, rather strange. I try to avoid this problem by putting a
remark at the beginning of this line. Then I insert the line :

    F$ = "DH2:test.iff"

    I re-run the program, and select the LOAD option. The program loads the
picture... and crashes totally my system !!!


    I tried several times, even by booting with no startup-sequence, but
that's always the same result... The intuiviewer worked fine with the 
demo version, though...


    So I started from scratch, opened a 4 colors hires screen and called 
a file requester : same problem (out of memory). I've got the latest 
version of the reqtools library, so I think it is not the source of the 
problem...



	Now, something different :

	First, about the demos I'll code : I think that the user would be 
interested in small and simple demos. Indeed, if someone wants to know 
how to use gadgets or requesters, he won't feel like reading a 1000 lines 
program just to find the topic he's interested in... So I suggest small 
programs, each devoted to a specific feature of your extension 
(requesters, gadgets, sliders, and so on). Do you agree with me ?


	Now, to develop Collector (sorry I forgot it at home ! I'll send 
you as soon as possible), I'll need a special feature that is not yet 
available in your extension : the possibility to unpack packed pictures 
into an intuition screen. So, could you implement it ? Only unpacking is 
needed, and no change must be made to the code by Francois Lionet (only 
redirection to an intuition screen). I need to unpack 4 bitplanes pics at 
any coordinates on the screen (16 pixels boundaries for X coordinates are 
okay for me). Hope this will be done soon ;-)


    Okay, that's all for today ! See you !
