Hello,

I just remembered a problem I encountered with your intuition 
extension....

I have a problem with the 'igadget down' command in that it doesn't 
always seem to respond correctly...also perhaps because of this if 
you have a hit gadget ( i use one for left and right arrows for a 
scroll bar) and you move the mouse off the gadget whilst the mouse button 
is still down, the program interprets the hit gadget as being 
depressed all the time. So when you let go of the mouse button, the 
slider will continue to move, as it is processing the gadget as being 
hit still. I hope you understood that! Anyway I was wondering if the 
intuition extension has been updated and rereleased at all and how I 
could get hold of it. Also are there any sample programs anyone has 
written anywhere.....for example, for creating a scroll list. I've 
written my own but it's a bit slow and cumbersome.

Thanks,
JOE.
