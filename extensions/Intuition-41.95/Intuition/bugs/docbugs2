I have no idea what you're talking about?!? I have never encountered any 
'stretched' menus.

I did some more testing. I did the following things:
-I inserted a Wait Key before the Igadget Read$ command: flip back to 
Amos to press the key and: error 8000 000B.
-I inserted an Iwait Key before Igadget Read$: error 8000 0004.
-I made a minimal program. See below for the pseudo code version. Result: 
error 8000 0004.
'	Iscreen open
	Reserve Igadget 1
	Set Igadget String 1
	Repeat Until Igadget Read$ = "Quit"	'

-I noticed on the "Set Screen Title" page a link to "=Iscreen Title 
Height" that is not on the "Screen Commands" page. What does it do 
anyway. Can't you just use something like Text Height (or whatever the 
command is) to determine how high the titlebar will be?
-I tried to test the new commands, but the tokeniser decided against it.
Set Iscreen Title	becomes		Set Iscreen TITLE
=Iscreen Title Height	becomes		=Iscreen TITLE HEIGHT
Set Iwindow Title	becomes		Set Iwindow TITLE

Although I was looking for bugs, I did not use any system in looking. I 
currently have not got much time on my hands (not entirely true, as I am 
trying to learn E at the same time). I suggest that you put some old 
betatesters back to work, considering the ease I stumble across these 
bugs (even though most of them are small).
