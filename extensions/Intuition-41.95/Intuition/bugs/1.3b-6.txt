DEAR MR. CHURCH,
     LET ME SAY I ENJOY YOUR EXTENSION FOR AMOS VERY MUCH. I CURRENTLY
USE IT WITH AMOS PROFESSIONIAL V2.0 ON MY AMIGA 1200.

     I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE Iclear Mouse and Iclear All commands and
i am hopeful you that you can help me. These two commands when used in
in a loop when you want to deactivate a imouse click don't always work.
By the way I have written many programs using Amos and Amos professional
and I have one or two on Fred Fish CDs. I only tell you this to let you
know that I usually know what I am doing. My loop looks something like
this:
      If imouse key=1
          iclear mouse
   if X>amount and X<amount and Y>amount and Y<amount
       proc name
    end if
end if

X and Y are x=imouse x and y=imouse y

)Problem: mouse key goes off sometimes without button being pressed.
          this only happens when I am over the coordinates.
Any help would be appreciated. I am using V1.3 of your extension.
yours truly - Kenneth McCormick
