First the good news: The colours are indeed fixed! The menus are still 
green on black, but so are the menus of a lot of pre-AGA and even some 
during-AGA software. Also the text is back to normal.

However, the reading of of the text gadget still causes an error, number 
8000 0004 to be exact. I used the program I sent you for testing it.

I am now trying to get to grips with E and EYacc, so testing will be a bit 
slow these days. However, I did manage to go through the docs, and these 
are the faults I discovered:
Intuition Guide v.1.3b:
-Contents screen:
	-There is no registration link. Is this because these are the 
'registered' docs?
	-Index button does not do anything.
-What does the Intuition Extension need to run:
	-It does not mention that it does not run under pre-2.0 Amos Pro. 
I know it does in the notes, but why not mention it here?
	-What are KS 1.3b and Amos 1.3b?
-The future:
	-I believe you already put in Window and Screen title.
manipulation commands.
-Window Commands:
	-The link "Set Iwindow Title" points to "Set Iscreen Title".
-Screen Commands: 
	-The link "Set Iscreen Title" will generate an error.
-Command Index:
	-The link "Set Iwindow Title" points to "Set Iscreen Title".
	-"Set Iscreen Title" is not in the index.

I have not tested the new commands yet.
