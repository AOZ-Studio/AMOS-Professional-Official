No, nothing to do with him - I've only got beta versions that you've sent me 
direct -
but somehow I've manage to cock up the installation.

You misunderstand me - I don't mean a way to specify all 256 colours of an AGA
screen - I mean instead of specifing RGB values with 0-$F for each of red, 
green,
and blue, allow the use of 0-$FF for each component so the full AGA palette can
be used instead of every 16th colour.
