Thanks Andy, that Iwait Event should speed up my program quite a bit hopefully
as I can go direct to the code triggered from a gadget rather than checking
all the gadgets to see which one is used.

If you remember, I mailed you about a couple of bugs in the input systeM,
where clicking on a gadget and then moving away from it while the mouse button
was still down, would leave the gadget 'down' (Igadget down) even when
the mouse was released. This meant that if you input some text into a 
string gadget and then clicked somewhere else on the screen with the mouse
then the string gadget was registered as 'down'...until the user went back
to it and pressed return in the string gadget. I don't know if you have
\sorted this out but I'll do some tests when I get home.

One effect of the above problem was that (on my instrument slider which se
lected an instrument as in Octamed), if I moved the mouse off the hit button
that registered a UP or DOWN , if I moved the mouse off it, it would keep
selecting the next instrument as the code interpreted the gadget as 'down'
when it shouldn't have been.

Anyway I suppose I should go and test it before telling you about the bugs
becaUSE you've probably fixed them by now!\

ThANks again,
JOE
