Greetings:

 Screen modes reported as follows:

        NTSC      - 00011000
        Multiscan - 00031000
        Euro 72   - 00061000
        Euro 36   - 00071000
        DBLNTSC   - 00091000

 Dblntsc reported some extra screen modes at 00091200, 
    but $91000 works perfectly.

 As for my Ipalette problem, I'm using AMOS 2.0 compiler, and amiga dos
 2.04 and 3.0.
 This is enough to crash my computer:
    Iscreen Open 1,640,200,4,Hires,"s_test" : Iwait Vbl
    Ipalette $987,$0,$EEF,$6C

 How do I set the X,Y,W,H of requestor windows?

 allso heres some ideas for new commands:

   Iscreen Height Wb
   Iscreen Width Wb
   Iscreen Colour Wb
   Iscreen Mode Wb

   you need a screen setting (eg. hires, lowres) for Productivity.

 If I and my 1200 can be of any more help, just mail :)
