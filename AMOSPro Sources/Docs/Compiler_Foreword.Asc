AMOSPro Compiler Foreword

Welcome to the AMOSPro Compiler! 

In this box, you will find a magic utility that will enhance the
global speed of your programs by a factor of two to three!
Not only this utility will make your program run like the wind, but
it will entierely recode them so that it is virtually impossible
to look at your code: you can now turn all your production into
public domain, shareware or even publication software.

We have also crammed a lot of examples on the disc, games, utilities,
demos to show to enhancement brought by compiling. Just run them
through the AMOSPro interpretor first, compile them and look to the
difference! 
Then have fun exploring the code: we have inserted as many comments
as possible...

You will also be glad to hear that this box also include a version
of AMOSPro (V 2.0) that includes major enhancements, like AGA support.
Of course the compiler also cope with the AGA graphics modes: you can
now have ultra-fast bobs over a 256 colour hires screen...

A considerable re-writing job has been done on AMOSPro and the compiler.
The resulting software is now much easier to modify and ammend. The
obvious advantage is for you, the user: AMOSPro and its compiler
will evolve very fast. Be ready for new instructions, new modes,
new possibilities every three month: AMOSPro is a fast moving product,
and we want to have it moving even faster, at the speed of our 
beloved machine, the Amiga!

Now, insert the AMOSPro Compiler disc into your drive, fasten your
seatbelts, and be ready for speed!
