                                Introduction


The AMOSPro editor contains many advanced features. One of them is the
ability to launch AMOS programs as accessories.

To be an accessory a program has to respect a few rules:

- The SET ACCESSORY command must be used within the sourcecode
- The  program  must  be  launched from the AMOS menu, or assigned to a key
  shortcut.
- It must not be the currently edited program.

If  the  above conditions are respected the program will have full access to
the  source  code  of the current program.  This means it can edit the file,
save  it  or  do whatever necessary with it.  It even has full access to the
editor screen, and can even display into it!

This system is incredibly powerful. Almost anything is possible.

A few example ideas:

- A  palette  generator:   instead of typing in the colours by hand, call a
  palette accessory then select the colours with the mouse.  Upon quitting the
  accessory,  the  'Palette'  instruction  with the correct colours is created
  into the source!

- Source analyser, list out all procedure names, cross reference variable
  list etc.

- An interface between the AMOSPro editor and AREXX:  The accessory gets
  AREXX messages and transforms them into editor commands.

- An adventure generator

- The retokeniser is a good example: have a look at it.

- etc, etc.



                             How does it work?

Once  your  program  is  called  as  an  accessory,  it  can use two AMOSPro
instructions:  Ask Editor and Call Editor.

Optional  parameters  returned  by  the  editor  will be found in =Param and
=Param$.

All the editor calls are defined in AMOSPro_System_Equate file.  You'll need
to use the =Equ("") instruction to get the correct value.

* Call Editor FUNCTION [,PAR][,PAR$]

This  instruction is used to send commands to the editor.  It acts just like
a  TV  remote  controler:   making the editor cursor move, opening a window
etc.

FUNCTION:  the number of the function to be called, must begin with "AEd_"
PAR:   an  optional integer parameter, usually for requester simulated input
(stated for each function).
PAR$:  an optional string parameter, for example a file name.


* Ask Editor FUNCTION [,PAR][,PAR$]

As  the  name  implies, this instruction is used to get information from the
editor.

FUNCTION: the number of the function to be called. Must begin with "AEdAsk_"
PAR: the optional integer parameter
PAR$: the optional string parameter.
