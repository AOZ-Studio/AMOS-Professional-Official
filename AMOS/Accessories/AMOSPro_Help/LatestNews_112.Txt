A French Greetings list by François Lionet!

First of all, a small  apology.  1992  has  been  so  stressful that I was
unable to answer lots of my  mail.  AMOSPro  came  first. So if you didn't
receive any answer from a letter, please  forgive  me. It must be in my 30
inch high letter stack!

Being so busy during the final rush for finishing AMOSPro, I simply forgot
to write and add my greeting list to the main Help Menu.

I want to thank many people, in French! (Please get a dictionary.)

- Nicolas Costes et Pascal Varennes  de Commodore France. Très grand merci
pour votre support completement technique.
- Eric Andréani et Syntex,  pour  toutes  les magnifiques démos et surtout
pour être si sympas.
- Jean Michel Forgeas, l'être le  plus  patient  que je connaisse, qui m'a
tiré d'affaire bien des fois.
- Denis Bernard et Philippe Bouzitat pour tant de dynamisme. Je croise les
doigts pour le club.
- Yves Lamoureux pour sa patience (lui aussi). J'ai bientot fini, promis.
- Pascal Kasmerszac et ATACOM. Vivement ATACOM 93!
- Richard Vanner, of course, le project manager le plus sympa et
stressant que je connaisse.
- Christopher Payne qui m'a fait confiance au tout début d'AMOS.
- Et plein  d'autres  (dans  l'ordre  de  mon  agenda!): Pierre Berloquin,
Stephane Schreiber, Philippe  Ducalet,  Olivier  Coquet,  Philippe Ulrich,
Frédéric Botton, Thierry Drago,  Orion  Diffusion, Pierre Philippe Launay,
Francis Poulain, Nicolas Mathieu, Olivier Rogé,  Len and Ann Tucker, David
Gaussinel, Stephane Dujourdy, Neil  Miller,  Wayne  Johnson, Gilles Bihan,
Jerome Pages, Bruce Leppers, Johan Francois, Francois Scheurer...

..et encore pleins d'autres  de  qui  j'ai  usé  et  abusé  et qui ne m'en
voudront pas (j'espère) de ne pas figurer dans cette liste...

Features added to AMOS Professional

Many things  have  been  improved  compared  to  the  previous  version of
AMOSPro.


- AMOSPro now works on a AA machine (1200/4000).

You can now launch AMOSPro from  the  workbench  on a AA machine, and flip
between AMOSPro and the workbench.  AMOSPro  does  not yet exploit the new
resolution modes: we are currently working on it.
You should just switch off any virus checker or any resident utility  that
might  bring the workbench  screen to  the front while  AMOSPro is  on the 
screen (you can however, leave the screen blanker utility ON while AMOSPro
is running).
This small problem will be corrected in the true AA version of AMOSPro, to 
be released later this year.


- AMOSPro now works with a screen blanker.

A screen blanker can  work  under  the  workbench without causing problems
with AMOSPro. When AMOSPro  is  displayed  it  sends  fake mouse movements
every 5 seconds simulating a user  input. This prevents the screen blanker
from popping up in the background.


- The file selector has been vastly improved.

* Full Multitasking: the input/ouput of  the  file selector is now handled
by a separate task. You can safely type in a file name while the directory
is being read.

* STORE slider: instead of this  button's  old affect of displaying random
directories, you are now presented with a list of all the stored directory
pathnames. Just click on the pathname you  wish  to view and the list will
be presented.

* The Right mouse button now  has  an  affect. This was originally in AMOS
and Easy AMOS: click the  right  mouse  button  and you'll get the current
device list displayed in the file selector. Click again and you'll receive
the assign list, click another  time  and  you'll  get  the stored list of
directories, and another time brings you back to the directory you started
from.

* You can now enter full pathnames into the filename zone. For example, if
you type "Work:AMOS_Pro/Interpretor_Config.AMOS"  into  the  name zone and
press return, the filename will  be  computed into: "Work:AMOS_Pro" in the
path zone and  "Interpretor_Config.AMOS"  into  the  filename  zone. Press
RETURN another time to accept the name.

* Fast file finding: enter one letter  into the name zone, and press HELP,
the file list will be positioned  at  the begining of the specified letter
(or as close as possible. This feature  is best used on large directories,
there is no benefit if used in a directory of say nine files.


- The text reader now accepts hypertext.

By  using the enhanced  text reader, it is now possible to add interactive
help files to your programs and even have a professional looking window in
which to display the text.  This is a  simple process of just adding a few
codes into your text.

The hypertext system is of course based  on the AMOS  Interface  hypertext
system. It's best that you take  a  look  at  page 09.03.15 of the AMOSPro
User Guide and read up on the HyperText command before using this system.

You  can   also   edit   the   file   called   "Equate.Doc"   (located  in
AMOSPro_Productivity1:Equates.) This file is a  perfect  example of such a
text.

How to proceed.

* Your text must begin with a special code, of 8 letters:

  #HYPx000

#HYP tells the text reader that the text includes hypertext codes.

"x" is a number, from 1 to 9 informing the text reader how many hyper text
codes there will be on one line.

"000" is not used yet and is reserved for future expansions. You must keep
it to 000!

* Within the text define the  hypertext  zone using the normal method. The
action taken when the user clicks on your zone depends on the TYPE (string
or digit) of your zone.

  + Digit: the number reported by the zone is a LINE NUMBER. When the user
clicks on this zone, the text reader will simply go to the specified line.
Example:

      { [32 ,6,3]   How does it work?   }

      will branch to line #32 in case of click...

  + String: a click on this  zone  will  close  the text reader and report
the keyword to the main program  in  =Param$.  If  the user clicked on the
CLOSE icon of  the  text  reader,  =Param$  will  return  an empty string.
Example (from Equate.Doc):

      { [ADD,4,7] RUN and add equates current file }
      { [CRE,4,7] RUN and create a new equate file }
      { [QUT,4,7]     QUIT     }

     In the program:

      Read Text "Equates.Doc"
      If Param$="ADD"
      ...
      Else If Param$="CRE"
      ...
      Else
      ... Quit the program
      End If

Hyper-text is a  simple  and  user-friendly  way  of  creating menu driven
program documentation.


- Testing speed has been improved.

The testing process has  been  rewritten,  and  is  now  up  to 50% faster
(usually 30 to 40% on a 68000  based Amiga). The difference is obvious for
bigger programs such as the Disc Manager and the Object Editor.


- You can now configurate your  own  default  screen. Getting bored of the
orange lowres  screen?  You'd  prefer  it  to  be  workbench  grey,  hires
interlaced and overscanned? No problem,  just  set  it  up to your heart's
desire using the new options in the Interpreter_Config.AMOS program.

How to proceed?

 + Call the  "Set  Interpreter"  option  from  the  Config  menu under the
editor.
 + Load the Default Configuration
 + Select "System Configuration Page 1"
 + Select "Set Default Screen"
 + With the buttons, just define the characteristics of your screen.

 Number of bitplanes: 1 for 2 colours, 2 for 4 colours, 3 is 8 colours
                      4 is 16 colours. Hires mode on or off,
                      Interlaced mode on or off.

 + Use the sliders to set the colour palette.
 + Once the characteristics of your screen  are defined you can modify its
size and position on the screen by clicking on "Set Screen's Position"
 + When everything is done, just click  3  times on EXIT (you have to keep
moving  back  out  through   the   various   menus),   and  save  out  the
configuration. Your default screen will appear next time you boot AMOSPro.

Important Warning:
Some program may rely on the default "default screen". That is 320x200 16
colours, lowres with the old colour palette. They might stop with an error
or the display may be corrupted.  So  to  fix  these programs just add the
command:

  Screen Open 0,320,200,16,Lowres

to the start of the program's code.

- You can now configure the Amiga-A key combination. Up till now there has
been no choice, Amiga-A was  the  only  way  to  flip between AMOS and the
Workbench. Now you can define your very own key combination.

How to proceed?

+ Call the "Set Interpreter" option from the Config menu under the editor.
+ Load the Default Configuration
+ Select "System Configuration Page 2"
+ Enter the desired letter into the AMOS / Workbench edit zone
+ Click on the correct shift combination
+ Quit and save you  configuration.  The  new  key shortcut will be active
after your next boot.


- The ugly little workbench screen has been removed.
AMOSPro used to open a small screen at the bottom of the workbench display
to do its graphical  work.  Some  users  have  complained  about this (and
rightly so). It has now been removed.  In fact the entire screen system in
amos.library has been totally re-written so that it is much more
system-friendly.

- It is now possible to relocate the mouse pointer when in direct mode.
If you have lost your mouse pointer  (it's off the screen or you've hidden
it), just press the <HELP> key  and  the  mouse pointer will appear in the
top-left corner of the direct mode window.

- Direct mode history buffer now works exactly as the CLI history system.

- Closing the last window also  gives  you  the option to quit the AMOSPro
editor.
When you close the last available  window  of  the  editor, you now have a
requester asking whether  you  want  to  QUIT  AMOSPro  or  not.  It's not
necessary to select the QUIT option from the AMOS menu any more. NOTE: you
can even quit faster by quiting AMOSpro without any warning when you close
the last window. This is activated if  you de-select 'Confirm Quit' in the
"Quit Options" from the "Config" menu.

- Disc Manager format and copy.
The disc manager now  copies  discs.  It  can  also  copy  and format high
density discs on an Amiga 4000.

- The monitor does not single step through closed procedures anymore.
This allows much faster debugging:  just  open  the procedures you want to
step through and call the monitor. Any closed procedure will be treated as
a single instruction.


- The Resource Bank editor now has  a  "PRINT" option to print the strings
contained in the bank.


- The Editor remote control commands are now listed in the equate file.
You can have full details about all the commands by running the program:

  AMOSPro_Productivity1:Equates/Editor_Commands.AMOS

{[IHelpInf ,4,3] Back to main menu }


Problems removed from Version 1.0

With your help, we  have  been  able  to  locate  and remove the following
problems from V1.0:


* Main instruction set

- =Dev Check function used to return 0 just after opening the device.

- Device instructions now check for the completion of the previous command
before sending a new one.

- Printer device now send its requester to AMOSPro and not the workbench
screen as it used to do.

- The equate system  now  works  fine.  For  more  information on equates,
please run AMOSPro_Productivity1:Equates/Make_Equates.AMOS

How to install Compiler and 3D Extensions

* Please note: The Compiler extension only works with the old Compiler. Not
  the new AMOS Pro Compiler which is due for release June 1993. You can only
  compile programs that use the old AMOS command set. New commands in AMOS
  Pro must be compiled with the new Compiler.

This disc  includes  special  versions  of  the  AMOS1.3  Compiler  and 3D
extensions that work under AMOSPro.

Warning:   in  order  to  run the Compiler under AMOSPro, you must possess
AMOS  V1.34 and Compiler V1.34 (or over).  If you don't have versions this
high,  order  the  1.34 updates (2 discs) from your usual PD library.  You
can also order the discs from any of the AMOS Clubs.

Any version of 3D can be updated to work under AMOSPro.

The following information is supplied for both Compiler and 3D.  Of course,
if you just own Compiler, skip past information on 3D, and vice-versa.

You just have to follow the  installation procedure, which depends greatly
on your system's configuration.

			{[IExFloppy  ,4,3]  You do not have a hard drive  }
			{[IExHard    ,4,3]      You have a hard drive     }

{[IHelpInf ,4,3] Back to main menu }

Installing Compiler or 3D without a hard drive.

Create a working disc containing:

	AMOS1.34, the Compiler and/or 3D extensions installed.

This disc will be used by AMOSPro's new extensions.  3D can then access the
file  "c3D.lib"  from  it,  and Compiler will grab the Compiler and all the
necessary  libraries  from  it.   This  method  leaves  your AMOSPro_System
untouched  and  avoids  having  to  delete files to make room for 3D and/or
Compiler.   In  fact  there  isn't  room  on a floppy disc for AMOSPro, the
Compiler libraries and 3D.

Follow these instructions carefully:

- Boot AMOSPro in the usual manner

-  Load  the  disc  manager  from  the  User  menu  (which now copies discs
properly).

- Now make a backup of your AMOSPro_System disc before beginning.  You must
work  with a backup!

Note:   Once you've installed AMOSPro with new extensions you may find that
AMOSPro  fails to load.  This will be due to AMOSPro being asked to load an
extension  that  just can't be found or isn't compatible with the extension
location  it's  being  loaded  into.  If this were to happen you can easily
revert back to your backup copy and start again.  Otherwise you'll never be
able to get back into AMOSPro. So please take the time to back-up your
original.

-  From  the  Disc Manager open the "Extensions" folder on the root of your
   AMOS Professional Productivity disc 2.

- For the Compiler, copy the file:

  AMOSPro_Productivity2:Extensions/AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib

directly into your APSystem folder of your back-up AMOSPro System disc.

- For 3D, copy the file:

  AMOSPro_Productivity2:Extensions/AMOSPro_3D.Lib

directly into your APSystem folder of your AMOSPro System disc.

It should fit on the disc, but very tightly.  You will need to remove a few
files.   AmigaDos  will  damage  a  disc beyond recognition if it gets over
full, so we suggest that you remove the following file:

  AMOSPro_System:Install_Data/Explosion.Abs

This file contains the installer graphics data for the title.  Removing it
will  not  prevent  the  installer  from working, but will simply skip the
title.

- For the Compiler, copy the file:

  AMOSPro_Productivity2:Extensions/APCmp

directly into your AMOS_System folder  on  your  AMOS 1.34 disc. It should
sit next to "ACmp" the original Compiler for AMOS1.34.

- Quit the Disc Manager and call the Interpreter Configuration accessory.

- Load the default configuration

- Select "Set Loaded Extensions"

-  For  the  Compiler:   click  on  line  number  5,  and enter the
following line EXACTLY as it appears here:

  AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib -fAMOS:AMOS_System/

-  For 3D:  click on line number 4, and enter the following line EXACTLY as
it appears here:

  AMOSPro_3D.Lib -fAMOS:AMOS_System/

- Save the default configuration and quit the program.

-  If  you're installing the Compiler, load "Compiler.AMOS", and change the
line at the beginning of the program.

Original line:

  DPATH$=":AMOS_System"

Change it to:

  DPATH$="AMOS:AMOS_System"

Note:   Ensure  the  disc  with  AMOS1.34,  Compiler1.34 and/or 3D is still
called  "AMOS:".   If  it  has  changed, rename it using the Workbench menu
option.

Save Compiler.AMOS to disc.

- Reboot your computer. AMOSPro should  boot  and load the new extensions.
Check it with the "About New Extensions" menu option.

- Compiler: when you call the Compiler, make sure your AMOS1.34 disc is
 present in a drive. All Compiler data will be loaded from there.

- 3D:  you will be asked to insert your AMOS1.34 disc to load the "c3D.lib"
library.   If you're not short of memory, use the "TD KEEP" command to keep
the 3D library in memory after it has been loaded for the first time.

 		{[IExInfo  ,4,3] Read this important Compiler information }

Installing Compiler or 3D with a hard drive

-  If  you own AMOS1.34 with the Compiler and 3D, your original AMOS_System
folder should be located at the root of your current partition.  This means
that  both  3D and Compiler extensions when run from AMOSPro can access the
files  by  using  the following pathname:

	":AMOS_System/".

If  your  AMOS_System  folder  is elsewhere on your hard disc then read the
text below located at the (*) marker now.

- Load the Disc Manager utility.

- Open the "Extensions" folder on the root of your AMOS Professional
  Productivity disc 2.

- Copy the files:

  AMOSPro_Productivity2:Extensions/AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib
  AMOSPro_Productivity2:Extensions/AMOSPro_3D.Lib"

directly into your APSystem folder on your hard drive.

- Load the Default Configuration

- Select "Set Loaded Extensions"

- For Compiler click on line number 5, and enter the following line EXACTLY
as it appears here:

  AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib

- For 3D: click on line number 4, and enter the following line EXACTLY as
it appears here:

  AMOSPro_3D.Lib

- Save the default configuration, quit the program and quit AMOSPro.

- Reboot AMOSPro, your new extension  should  be loaded into memory. Check
it with the option "About Loaded Extensions" from the editor menu.

- You can now use 3D and Compiler as normal.

(*) Your AMOS_System folder is not  located  at the root directory

- Write down the FULL, EXACT pathname of your AMOS_System folder.  The name
must  include  the  Device:  and all sub directories.  It should end with a
":" or a "/".

- Proceed as explained  above,  except  when  you  enter  the names of the
extensions in the Interpreter Configuration.

- Enter the name of the extension, followed by "-fpath", where path is the
pathname of your extension. There should not  be any space between "f" and
the pathname.

- Load "Compiler.AMOS", and change the  following line at the beginning of
the program:

 Old line:

  DPATH$=":AMOS_System"

 New line:

  DPATH$="...path of your extensions..."

 Warning, There must not be a "/" character at the end of the path!

 Example:

 * Path to extension: Work:AMOS/AMOS_System/

 * Compiler definition: AMOSPro_Compiler.Lib -fWork:AMOS/AMOS_System/

 * 3D definition: AMOSPro_3D.Lib -fWork:AMOS/AMOS_System/

 * In Compiler.AMOS: DPATH$="Work:AMOS/AMOS_System"

		{[IExInfo  ,4,3] Read this important Compiler information }

Important information about the Compiler

This new Compiler extension will  allow  you  to  call AMOS Compiler V1.34
from AMOSPro. This is NOT  the  new  AMOSPro  Compiler which is currently
still under development at this stage (18/01/93). As a consequence:

- The Compiler will only Compile 1.34 compatible programs.  Use the "Check
1.34"  option  from  the  "Project" menu under the editor.  Obviously, the
Compiler  will  not  compile  any  new  instructions, and will refuse bank
numbers over 16.

- If you compile a program as .AMOS type it will only run under AMOS1.34.
This is because AMOS1.34 has different call equates to AMOSPro.

- The configuration files used by  the  Compiler  are not the ones used by
AMOSPro. The Compiler uses:

  AMOS1_3_PAL.ENV (or NTSC) with error messages, or
  RAMOS1_3.ENV without error messages.

You should use your  "Config1_3.AMOS"  program  to  change anything in the
configuration for the Compiler.

          CALLING "INTERPRETER_CONFIG" FROM THE AMOSPRO EDITOR
                     WILL NOT AFFECT THE COMPILER!!!

The future updates

AMOS Professional is kept up-to-date and modern all the time. This is
version 1.12 which is the result of four months extra work on the project
after the initial release of V1.0.

So keep up-to-date with the latest version by calling the AMOS Clubs or the
AMOS PD library.

We will continue with our update  policy.  Here  is some of the things you
can wait for in the future:

- Intuition On  /  Off  to  display  an  AMOS  Screen  under intuition and
  therefore create real workbench applications.
- New instruction to handle intuition screens.
- More integration to the Amiga's system.
- and all your good ideas!
