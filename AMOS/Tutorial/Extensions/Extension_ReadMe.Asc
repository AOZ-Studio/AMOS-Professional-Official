Hello everybody! François typing on the keyboard to give you more information
on the AMOSPro Extension system.

1. Starting an extension from scratch.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You have never created an extension before and you want to make
your new instruction set.

No problemo. All you need is:

	- An assembler (GenAm2 or 3 preferably)

	- All the include files in this folder

	- Skill, and patience. All the necessary explanations
	  are given in the file |Music.s.
	  I suggest that instead of starting an extension from scratch,
	  you begin by changing one that already exists. A simple
	  one like |Compact.s is a good example. This way, all the crucial
	  inits are already provided.

	- Note, you can easily debug you code by placing an "Illegal" in
	  your code. This will stop AMOSPro and you can then press [Amiga]+[A]
	  to flip back to the workbench display. This works because Amiga-A is
	  handled by interrupts.


2. Transfering an AMOS1.3 extension.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First of all, sorry for changing the format of the equates file,
and forcing you to re-assemble your code. I have had to change things
so that I could implement all the nice features of AMOSpro. I have also
progressed a lot since the first AMOS, and I have discovered ugly things that 
NEEDED to be removed.

On the bright side, 99.9% of change is a simple re-assemble of your code using
the new equates, and then it should work.

What exactly has changed?

	- The equates, as mentioned before. Just use "Include |AMOS_Include.s"

	- The RJsr calls to the main AMOSPro function library.
	  The new ones are much better, and more powerful. For example
	  all the necessary bank handling functions are re-written.
	  You can now call the file selector from within your extension.
	  You must read the "|Music.s" file to have the list of
	  all available instructions.

	- WARNING: L_Bnk.OrAdr uses D0 to input the number of the 
	  bank, and not D3 any more! Check your code if you use it.

	- The title format has also changed: the "10" character is
	  no longer needed. You can also have AMOS call your own
	  title routine if you want.

The AMOSPro compiler will accept your extension code.

I can inform you now, when new Commodore machines are out, 
you (and I) will have to create new extension code to use the new 
features. But, that's the way it goes.


3. What number should you use for your extension.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please use a number from 26 and downwards. Official AMOSpro
extensions are from 1 upward. This way yours and ours will
never collide!

The extension number is CRUCIAL for your code to work. AMOSPro
will refuse to boot if the number of the extension in the list
is not the same as the one returned by the code.
So check your code.

To register an official AMOS Extension contact Richard Vanner at
Europress Software. He will confirm the numbers validity and ensure
future extensions don't collide.


4. Why do I use a "|" character before all my source names?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hehehe. Doing this ensures all the source code file are automatically
sorted at the end of the file selector display. Faster and easier to 
locate!


Well, that's all for now, have fun. Francois.
