### Welcome to the official AMOS Professional source code repository.

You will find in this repository the entire source code of AMOS Professional, as it was on my machine at the end of 1993 when I decided to switch to PC and create Klik and Play with my partner Yves Lamoureux.

This source-code is published under the MIT licence, which means you can do anything you want from it as long as the copyright notice is present in both the modified source code and the boot screen of the application. I have unfortunately forgotten how you can compile it and would appreciate to receive an extra documentation, if you have managed to compile, so that I can include it is this readme. Do not hesitate to contact me by mail about this.

I am delighted to see that this code, that was made at a very special moment of my life, is still alive 30 years after it was written. I cannot wait to discover what you will do with it. Be creative!

Please note that I will not answer to any technical questions as I do not remember how it works and all this is for me the past. Even if the Amiga is and will always be in my heart, my focus is the future and this future is called AOZ.

This distribution is based on the repository created by marc365. https://github.com/marc365/AMOSProfessional

I have added the MIT licence headers to all the sources. If you know about a newer of better version of the source-code, do not hesitate to send it to me by mail, I will gladly update the repository.

Thank you Marc365! I have included your readme after this intro.

This repository is 68k Assembly and unique in design. It is powerful and runs like an operating system. Games and multimedia become exciting to program again, relying on your own skills instead of libraries.

This release is as-is and doesn't contain any installation or demos.

It's really fun and will test your "actual" programming skills!

# AMOS Professional

based on the original 68000 source code by François Lionet (Thank you!)

# History
Some years ago there was discussion of re-development, but the work mentioned in [this article](http://www.amiworld.it/news/amos_upgrade_eng.html) was not made public, any collaborative efforts have disappeared. An archive was made available at a later date but was partially incomplete and difficult to build - this project fixes the build problems, but has no relation to any previous plans or news releases.

# AMOS PRO goes Public Domain!

> [01 dec 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20130530022407/http://www.pianetaamiga.it)
In occasion of Pianeta Amiga 2012, Pietro Ghizzoni, current owner of AMOS Pro sources after Francois Lionet ceased development, has kindly agreed to release them as Public Domain. You can download the full package in advance from this link. Sources will be also put on Aminet in the next days.

# AMOS present and future

> [pre Public Domain ?](http://www.amiworld.it/news/amos_upgrade_eng.html)
As you know some months ago i've obtained the AMOS sources... during these months I've spent my time learning the AMOS internal functions and structures, in order to upgrade it and develop the new AMOSPro V3... but I've to say that my projects have changed a lot during this period. My original idea was to upgrade/expand it, add AGA support and most of all to make AMOS more OS friendly! but when I examined the sources some problems have arisen...
